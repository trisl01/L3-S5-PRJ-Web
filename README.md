## Contents
This project will be a demonstration of your skills in Vue:
- Content Behaviours
- From Bindings
- Rendering Styles
- Components

My Vue code lectures on GitHub is fully commented and the ReadMe file can guide you to try Vue SFC with legacy tool CLI or trying Vue with Vite. Or you can simply just use the CDN link as I meanly demonstrated in my in-person lectures. My Vue Repo [GitHub Link](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/vue.js-intro)

Now, to try something new, useful, and interesting (3 in one ), I am asking you as teams of 3 students each, to create your full final Vue project based on the [Vue Official Tutorial Link on their Vue Mastery YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/bzlFvd0b65c)!
This tutorial is built on the fast and practical approach for using Vue from CDN to create a micro project which is the same thing as we focused on in our class.

## Instructions
You can follow the exact instruction from A to Z in the tutorial video to create your app, but for sure you will have to
come up with different styles, layout, color themes, images and most important the topic of your website, don’t use
the same topics of selling socks!

As I always mention, please feel free to add more features and go beyond the instructions if you want. You can also use “SFC” idea with “Vite” tools if you like, for more details and intensive explanation, you can refer to my GitHub code and ReadMe file (the link above). However, following tutorial instruction to accomplish your final project is all what’s required in this project, anything beyond is up to you.

## Get started
In the terminal, run:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run dev
```
