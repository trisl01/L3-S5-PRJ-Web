My Vue code lectures on GitHub is fully commented and the ReadMe file can guide you to try Vue SFC with legacy tool CLI or trying Vue with Vite. Or you can simply just use the CDN link as I meanly demonstrated in my in-person lectures. My Vue Repo [GitHub Link](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/vue.js-intro)

Now, to try something new, useful, and interesting (3 in one ), I am asking you as teams of 3 students each, to create your full final Vue project based on the [Vue Official Tutorial Link on their Vue Mastery YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/bzlFvd0b65c)!
This tutorial is built on the fast and practical approach for using Vue from CDN to create a micro project which is the same thing as we focused on in our class.
